Beyond Eyes 	Original 	During the ante step of each beat, Seth may name a single base (including the opponent's unique base). As long as the nearest opponent's attack includes the named base, then Seth gains +2 Power and +2 Priority during that beat and wins priority ties.

If the opponent's base changes due to a clash or other effect, Seth loses these bonuses (priority order cannot change once it is established, however).

Green 	Mimic's 	+0 	+1 	+0 	
Whenever the nearest opponent moves this turn, you move in the same direction, maintaining your range if possible. (So for each space the opponent advances, Seth retreats, and vice-versa. Ignore direct moves.)

Blue 	Wyrding 	+0 	+0 	+0 	
Start of Beat: If you correctly guessed an opponent's base this beat with Seth's Beyond Eyes ability, you may choose a new base from your hand and replace the one in this attack pair (Active Player does not change). Both the new and original base go to your discard.

FINISHER 	Fortune Buster 	1-6 	N/A 	13
