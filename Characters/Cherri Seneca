Nightmarish Visions 	Original 	

Cherri begins a duel with one Insight Token. She cannot have more than one of these tokens at a time. When she takes 3 or more damage at once, she regains her Insight Token. If Cherri antes her Insight Token, a clash occurs as a Reveal effect, regardless of priority (a Finisher can't be clashed).

If a player reveals a Special Action, then the token has no effect. Whenever Cherri clashes with an opponent or extends a clash, that opponent loses 1 life.
