Custom Ammunition 	Original 	

Rukyuk begins each duel with six custom Ammo Tokens. Each token has a specific effect printed on it that can be added to an attack by anteing the token. 

If Rukyuk does not ante an Ammo Token during the ante phase, his attacks cannot hit an opponent during that beat. He may ante only one Token each beat.

Rukyuk can recover Tokens with his Reload base.
