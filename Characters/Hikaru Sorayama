Geomantic Assault

Hikaru begins a duel with four Elemental Tokens: Fire, Water, Wind, and Earth. Hikaru cannot have more than one of each type of token.

Hikaru may ante up to one token each beat to gain the effect of that token applied to his attack.

Fire: Power +3

Water: Range -1~+1

Wind: Priority +2

Earth: Soak 3

Hikaru's styles and unique base allow him to recover Elemental Tokens. He cannot recover a token the same turn he antes it.
