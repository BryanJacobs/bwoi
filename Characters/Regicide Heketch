DARK FORCE

Heketch has one Dark Force Token at the start of a duel.

He may ante this token to immediately move adjacent to an opponent and gain +3 priority. (This movement takes place during the ante step.)

At the end of a beat, if there are 2 or more spaces between Heketch and the nearest opponent, and if he does not have a Dark Force token, he regains his Dark Force token.
